The Enablers Code Review:

Our group reviewed the code of Birds Eye View. In reviewing, we found their classes to be well encapsulated and loosely coupled. In a few places they had duplicate code blocks that should have just been a function rather than duplicate code. Additionally, all of their views were separated from their data. Their code was written in Java and, while it was commented, we suggested that they switch to using JavaDoc as a more standardized and informative comment standard. They appeared to be using the K&R coding standard and generally followed that with regard to braces, camel case variable and function names, trailing whitespace, and so on. They were not consistent in usage of spaces between function parameters. One of their classes used a mix of tab characters and spaces and should be fixed. Additionally, one class was inconsistent in the naming convention of variables and one group member's work was inconsistent in use of referencing member variables using "this." vs not. Another group member was inconsistent in line break usage in function calls.

Our group was reviewed by Inferno Entertainment. They were unfamiliar with both Dart and PHP but they said we had insufficient comments in out Dart portions while out PHP comments were good. They also said out code was easy to read and understand. Our code is split into small cohesive classes that matched our class diagram. Our code conformed to our coding standard (K&R) but in some places our braces were inconsistent. They commented that our MySQL queries could be more efficient by being more specific and not just using "SELECT *". They also pointed out that our site might be vulnerable to cross site request forgery.
